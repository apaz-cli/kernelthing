# Code Review - Round {{CURRENT_ROUND}}

## Original Implementation Plan

**IMPORTANT**: The original plan that implementer is implementing is located at:
@{{PLAN_FILE}}

You MUST read this plan file first to understand the full scope of work before conducting your review.
This plan contains the complete requirements and implementation details that implementer should be following.

Based on the original plan and @{{PROMPT_FILE}}, implementer claims to have completed the work. Please conduct a thorough critical review to verify this.

Below is implementer's summary of the work completed:

## Part 1: Implementation Review

- Your task is to conduct a deep critical review, focusing on finding implementation issues and identifying gaps between "plan-design" and actual implementation.
- Relevant top-level guidance documents, phased implementation plans, and other important documentation and implementation references are located under @{{DOCS_PATH}}.
- If implementer planned to defer any tasks to future phases in its summary, DO NOT follow its lead. Instead, you should force implementer to complete ALL tasks as planned.
  - Such deferred tasks are considered incomplete work and should be flagged in your review comments, requiring implementer to address them.
  - If implementer planned to defer any tasks, please explore the codebase in-depth and draft a detailed implementation plan. This plan should be included in your review comments for implementer to follow.
  - Your review should be meticulous and skeptical. Look for any discrepancies, missing features, incomplete implementations.
- If implementer does not plan to defer any tasks, but honestly admits that some tasks are still pending (not yet completed), you should also include those pending tasks in your review.
  - Your review should elaborate on those unfinished tasks, explore the codebase, and draft an implementation plan.
  - A good engineering implementation plan should be **singular, directive, and definitive**, rather than discussing multiple possible implementation options.
  - The implementation plan should be **unambiguous**, internally consistent, and coherent from beginning to end, so that **implementer can execute the work accurately and without error**.

## Part 2: Goal Alignment Check (MANDATORY)

Read @{{GOAL_TRACKER_FILE}} and verify:

1. **Acceptance Criteria Progress**: For each AC, is progress being made? Are any ACs being ignored?
2. **Forgotten Items**: Are there tasks from the original plan that are not tracked in Active/Completed/Deferred?
3. **Deferred Items**: Are deferrals justified? Do they block any ACs?
4. **Plan Evolution**: If implementer modified the plan, is the justification valid?

Include a brief Goal Alignment Summary in your review:
```
ACs: X/Y addressed | Forgotten items: N | Unjustified deferrals: N
```

## Part 3: Required Finding Classification

You MUST classify your findings into these lanes:
- **Mainline Gaps**: plan-derived work or AC progress that is missing, incomplete, or regressing
- **Blocking Side Issues**: bugs or implementation issues that block the current mainline objective from succeeding safely
- **Queued Side Issues**: valid non-blocking follow-up issues that should be documented but must NOT take over the next round

Also include a one-line verdict:
```
Mainline Progress Verdict: ADVANCED / STALLED / REGRESSED
```

This verdict line is mandatory. If you omit it, the Humanize stop hook will block the round and require the review to be rerun.

If implementer mostly worked on queued side issues and failed to advance the mainline, say so explicitly.

## Part 4: {{GOAL_TRACKER_UPDATE_SECTION}}

## Part 5: Output Requirements

- In short, your review comments can include: problems/findings/blockers; claims that don't match reality; implementation plans for deferred work (to be implemented now); implementation plans for unfinished work; goal alignment issues.
- Your output should be structured so implementer can tell which items are mainline gaps, blocking side issues, and queued side issues.
- If after your investigation the actual situation does not match what implementer claims to have completed, or there is pending work to be done, output your review comments to @{{REVIEW_RESULT_FILE}}.
- **CRITICAL**: Only output "COMPLETE" as the last line if ALL tasks from the original plan are FULLY completed with no deferrals
  - DEFERRED items are considered INCOMPLETE - do NOT output COMPLETE if any task is deferred
  - UNFINISHED items are considered INCOMPLETE - do NOT output COMPLETE if any task is pending
  - The ONLY condition for COMPLETE is: all original plan tasks are done, all ACs are met, no deferrals or pending work allowed
- The word COMPLETE on the last line will stop implementer.
